    "## The Moran Model\n",
    "The Moran model is a population genetic model first proposed by Patrick Moran in 1958. (I know a Pat Moran but he's just a terrible DJ.) In its most basic form, The Moran model tracks the changes in allele frequency due purely to genetic drift. \n",
    "\n",
    "We imagine a haploid population that has one of two alleles for some gene, say `A` and `a`. We randomly replace individuals in the population with these two alleles until one completely takes over and the other goes extinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to me, after reading this chapter that Vellend's whole idea is based around not just the application of the ideas of population genetic 'fundamental forces' but also population genetic _models_. The Moran model is classic and well understood analytically. This means that if we buy into the idea of the population genetic forces we get some nice results for free. The big shift is that instead of talking about alleles, we talk about species and instead of talking about a population, we talk about a community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vellends description, we choose a number of years ($Y$) and for each year we perform the same set of operations a number of times equal to the number of individuals in our community ($N$). These operations are depicted here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](../resources/moran_model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps above are labelled with numbers:\n",
    "1. Chose a random individual to die (maybe shouldn't have used pictured of my best friend!)\n",
    "2. Chose a random living individual to reproduce\n",
    "3. Replace the dead individual with a member of the reproducing individual\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform each of these steps $Y \\times N$ times. We can precisely define some of the relevant quantities. We're going to define $S_i$ as the species label of individual $i$. Then we can define the species frequency and some important probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the frequency each species ($s$). This is just a fancy way of saying the number of members of one species divided by the total community size.\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_s = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^N \\delta_{S_i s}}{N}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important is the two species case that we consider in this chapter.\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^N \\delta_{S_i 1}}{N}; \\; \\; f_2 = 1 - f_1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steps above we draw randomly from the community which means that the probability of an individual of species 1 being chosen for reproduction is really simple.\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P_{birth}(S = 1) = f_1; \\;\\; P_{birth}(S=2) = 1 - f_1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is dumb and obvious but later, when we introduce selection it will be much less straight-forward."
