    "\n",
    "The difference, the _only_ difference, between this and the original Moran model is that we now consider fitness in who we select when drawing an individual to reproduce. Before we considered each individual equally but now we weight individuals of each species using their fitness. \n",
    "\n",
    "we represent this weighting by the `fit_ratio` parameter which described the ratio between species 1 fitness($k_1$) and species 2 fitness ($k_2$). Inorder to do this weighting without violating the rule that the probabilities of each species must add up to 1, we do the weighting like this:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{birth}(S=1) = \\frac{(k_1/k_2) f_1}{(k_1/k_2) f_1 + f_2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only change we have to make to the basic Moran model to introduce constant selection, and we will never have to consider the individual species' fitnesses on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temporally varying selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Vellend also introduces a 'temporally varying' selection. He introduces this after frequency dependence but his model is more like this constant selection model so we will consider that here. In Vellend's description, the change in time comes as a change in the fitness ratio that depends on the simulated year.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's say that we've arrived at our fitness ratio, we'll call this $\\gamma$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\gamma\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We do the temporal variation, at least the simple example vellend shows, by flipping the ratio every 10 years. In general we flip the ratio every $y_{flip}$ years. When we've gone through $y_{flip}$ years we simple redefine the fitness ratio as:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\gamma^{-1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "I've represented this in the code with a variable called `time_dep` that can either be `True` or `False`. If its true, we do the 10 year flip as shown in the chapter."
